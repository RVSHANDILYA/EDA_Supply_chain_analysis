# Supply Chain Analysis EDA & Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains code for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a linear regression model to analyze supply chain data. Below is a breakdown of the code and its functionalities:

## Data Preparation and Exploration:

### Loading Data:
- The data is loaded from a CSV file named `supply_chain_data.csv` using Pandas library.

### Data Overview:
- The dataset contains 100 rows and 24 columns, with each row representing a different product in the supply chain.
- Column names include information such as product type, SKU, price, availability, revenue generated, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping times, shipping carriers, shipping costs, supplier name, location, manufacturing details, inspection results, defect rates, transportation modes, routes, and costs.

### Missing Value Analysis:
- There are no missing values in the dataset, as confirmed by the absence of any `NaN` values.

### Deep Exploratory Analysis:
- Various exploratory analyses are conducted to gain insights into the dataset, including:
  - Count of product types, visualized using a bar plot.
  - Line plots showing the relationship between price and location for different product types (haircare, skincare, cosmetics).
  - Bar plots displaying SKU-wise prices for each product type.
  - Box plots showing the distribution of prices across different product types.
  - Histograms, KDE plots, violin plots, line plots, and distribution plots for selected numeric variables to visualize their distributions and relationships with revenue generated.

### Correlation Analysis:
- A correlation matrix heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between different numeric variables in the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing:

### Label Encoding:
- Categorical variables such as product type, customer demographics, shipping carriers, supplier name, location, inspection results, and transportation modes are encoded using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn.

### Data Type Conversion:
- Numeric variables are converted to appropriate data types, ensuring consistency and compatibility for further analysis and modeling.

### Feature Selection:
- Selected features (X) include various attributes related to pricing, availability, sales, demographics, shipping, manufacturing, inspection, defects, transportation, and costs. The target variable (y) is revenue generated.

## Model Building and Evaluation:

### Train-Test Split:
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 ratio.

### Feature Scaling:
- The features are standardized using StandardScaler to bring them to the same scale, preventing any single feature from dominating the model.

### Linear Regression:
- A linear regression model is trained on the scaled training data to predict revenue generated based on the selected features.

### Model Evaluation:
- The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using the R-squared (R^2) metric. The obtained R^2 score indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.

### Visualization of Predictions:
- A scatter plot and regression line are created to visualize the relationship between actual revenue generated and predicted revenue generated by the model.

## Conclusion:

The README provides an overview of the supply chain analysis conducted in this repository, detailing the data preprocessing steps, exploratory analysis, model building, and evaluation. The linear regression model's performance is assessed, and insights are drawn from the analysis to aid in decision-making and optimization within the supply chain.
